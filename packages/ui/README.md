# React Headless UI Kit

## Getting started

```bash
npm install ventileco-ui
```

```bash
pnpm add ventileco-ui
```

## Introduction

Ventileco UI is an open-source UI component library designed to build accessible design systems and web applications.

Most components are built with common UI patterns, saving developers the hassle of creating custom components from scratch every time. This process can be time-consuming and difficult.

As a result, many web components are often inaccessible, underperforming, or lacking essential features.

The goal of this project is to create an open-source library that can help the community build accessible and performant web design systems.

## Features

### Headless

This library adopts a headless component approach. Headless components do not enforce any specific styling or structure; they simply provide functionality. This allows developers the flexibility to structure the UI according to their needs. By separating the UI from the logic, headless components give developers the freedom to customize components according to their preferred design system or CSS framework.

Unlike traditional UI libraries, which often force a specific style and layout, headless components focus purely on functionality. Developers can easily integrate and customize them with their own styles and layouts, making the development process faster and more efficient.

### Accessibility

Designed with accessibility in mind, this library ensures that all users can navigate the web easily. By utilizing ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, it effectively communicates visual elements and interactions to screen reader users. Additionally, it fully supports keyboard navigation, making all interactive elements accessible via keyboard. This ensures that users with disabilities can freely explore and interact with websites.

### Lightweight

Ventileco UI is designed to be lightweight, ensuring minimal bundle size and optimal performance. By focusing on essential components and maintaining flexibility, the library avoids unnecessary bloat, making it a perfect fit for high-performance applications. This lightweight nature also helps to reduce load times, improving the overall user experience.

By using Ventileco UI, developers can create fast, accessible, and responsive applications without sacrificing performance or functionality.
